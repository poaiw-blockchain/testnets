# Governance

## Overview

This repository contains network configurations for PAW testnets. Governance
of this repository is simplified compared to the main PAW blockchain repo.

## Decision Making

### Network Configuration Changes

Changes to network configurations (genesis files, peer lists, chain metadata)
are reviewed and approved by the PAW core team.

**Process:**
1. Submit a pull request with proposed changes
2. Core team reviews for accuracy and security
3. Changes are merged after approval

### New Testnet Launch

Decisions about launching new testnets are made by the core team based on:
- Development milestones in the main PAW repository
- Community feedback and testing needs
- Infrastructure readiness

## Roles

### Core Team

The PAW core team maintains this repository and has final say on:
- Merging pull requests
- Network configuration decisions
- Testnet launch timing

### Validators

Validators participating in testnets can:
- Submit their peer information
- Report network issues
- Propose configuration improvements

### Community

Community members can:
- Fork and use configurations
- Report issues
- Submit improvements via pull requests
